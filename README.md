# About me
Hello! I'm Magdalena, a passionate and dedicated beginner in the field of Software Testing, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I recently earned my ISTQB Foundation Level certification, which has solidified my foundational knowledge in software testing principles and best practices.
On my GitHub, you'll find a collection of projects and examples showcasing my journey as I learn and grow in the field of software testing. I'm eager to start contributing to open-source projects in the future and collaborate with others who share a passion for improving software quality.

For now, I’m focused on building my skills, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect!
